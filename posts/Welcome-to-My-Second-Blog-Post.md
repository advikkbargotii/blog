# Welcome to My Second Blog Post!  

It's been about three weeks since my last post (school started, and everything flipped upside down—oops). Not much has happened personally, but on the career front, there's been a lot of movement: we're officially in **peak hiring season**—especially for internships.

## 🎯 What You Should Target  
If you're in my audience, your focus right now should be on:  
- **Internships**  
- **New Grad Roles**  

For internships, we're at the height of hiring season. Many students already have offers from places like Roblox, Wells Fargo, and other big names. If you're aiming for full-time new grad jobs, the main wave of postings usually comes a little later—but they're starting to appear now too.  

**Pro tip:** Applications are rolling, so the sooner you apply, the better!

## 🔍 Where to Find Jobs  
When I first started looking, I stuck to LinkedIn. The problem? By the time I found roles, the applicant pool was already overcrowded.  

Here's what's worked for me instead:  
1. **GitHub Repositories** – There are two very reliable repos (linked at the end of this post) that track internship and full-time openings. They're updated daily and even include details like citizenship requirements (super useful if you're in the US).  
2. **JobRightAI** – A platform that notifies you as soon as a new position opens that matches your interests.

## 📄 Your Resume: Marketing Yourself  
Your resume is your personal marketing tool. Over the past few weeks, I've talked to career advisors, alumni, and professionals from companies like Microsoft and even a YC startup. Here's the key lesson I learned:  

👉 **Highlight transferable skills.**  
Nobody expects you to know every programming language out there. What matters is showing that what you do know can transfer across tech stacks.  

Examples:  
- **Java** → transferable to C, C++, C#  
- **Python** → transferable to Go, JavaScript  

When I first started, I mainly built with Java (compiled) and Python (interpreted). Over time, through school and personal projects, I picked up JavaScript, Assembly, and C. But here's the thing: languages are secondary. **Skills are primary.** Syntax changes, but your problem-solving, debugging, and system design skills stay with you.

## 🤝 Networking & Connections  
We've all heard the advice: "Network, get referrals, build connections." But how?  

Here's what I recommend:  
- **Skip cold outreach to random LinkedIn users.** It rarely works.  
- **Start with your school's alumni.** Go to your university's LinkedIn page, filter for alumni working at companies or roles you're targeting, and send a short, personalized connection request.  

💡 Keep it under **100 characters**. Why? Because even though LinkedIn allows 300, the mobile notification preview only shows the first 100.  

And remember—don't bug people. Put yourself in their shoes; respectful, concise outreach always works better than spamming.

## 💾 Git: Your Best Friend  
I can't emphasize this enough: **use Git.**  

Two reasons:  
1. Backups of your work  
2. The ability to roll back to a previous version when things break (and they *will* break)  

It doesn't take much to get started—just a few CLI commands and maybe a couple of YouTube tutorials. The simplest way? Use GitHub. Whether it's for personal projects or professional work, Git is non-negotiable.

## Wrapping Up  
That's all for today! I'll try to be more consistent with these posts going forward.  

If you have questions, suggestions, or feedback, I'd love to hear from you. Feel free to DM me on LinkedIn.  

Until next time—  
**Happy coding 🙂**
