# AI Is No Longer the Future — It's the Now

Everyone says, *"AI is the future!"*  

I disagree. AI **was** the future — now it's the present, and it's here to stay.  

It's been a month or two since I started seriously grinding to land a big tech job or internship (I graduate in about a year). I've gotten a few interviews, made it past some selective ATS systems, and I think two things really helped:  

1. **AI-based projects**  
2. **A focused skill set**  

A wise man once said:  
> "If you have every technology under the sun on your resume, I'm going to assume you're a novice at all of them."  

Before that sunk in, I'll admit — I stretched the truth on my resume. If I saw a TikTok or read an article about a tech, I'd throw it on there. That got me *past* a few ATS filters, sure, but not into the places that mattered.

## Why ATS Doesn't Matter as Much Anymore  

Lately, most applications I submit instantly lead to an OA (online assessment) invite. ATS isn't the big gatekeeper it used to be — too many ways exist to bypass it now.  

The real filter?  

**Lengthy, tricky, mind numbing OA's.**  

One company even required me to solve a CTF (Capture the Flag) challenge before I could *submit* my application. I'm 99% sure I solved it right… still haven't heard back.  

And yes — quant positions take it even further. They want hyper-competitive, optimization-obsessed coders (because, well… money). The work might take years off your hairline, but the salary could easily fund the transplant.

## The Roblox OA That Felt Like… Roblox  

Recently, I took an OA from Roblox — a platform I loved as a teen. Their "problem-solving and communications" assessments? Actual games.  

A video game company assessing candidates through games — who knew? Honestly, I loved it. They also had a traditional CodeSignal OA and a decision-making test. It was one of the few OAs that felt creative.  

Not all are that fun, but I've learned to embrace them.

## My "Prep Stack"  

I think everyone should have one — like a tech stack, but for interview prep. Mine looks like this:  

1. **NeetCode + LeetCode** for DSA (and no, "No Cluely" won't cut it).  
2. **GitHub job repos** that post new openings daily.  
3. **AWS Associate Developer Cert** (still prepping for the exam).  
4. **Projects.** Build *anything*. Projects teach you more than most professors ever will.  

Some of mine:  
- A machine learning game that adapts to your moves and places traps strategically.  
- An LLM bias + hallucination detector with rewrite suggestions.  
- An environmental impact tracker for developers using git, pipelines, cloud, and LLMs.  
- A Pomodoro timer.  
- An app that reminds me to drink water (yes, I need this).  

I tend to get obsessed with aesthetics — intuitive UX and clean UI are my happy place.

## Why It Matters  

If you're a developer (aspiring or experienced), doing it **just** for the money will feel empty fast. You've got to love it more than you hate it — because, trust me, there will be days you hate it.

**What's in your prep stack?** Have you had any weird or fun OA experiences?
